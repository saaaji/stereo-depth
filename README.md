# stereo-depth

Temporary repo to store camera calibration scripts for custom stereo camera for CURO (CU Robotics). 
Will soon be moved to CURO's high-level repo.
* `src/cameracal.py`: Takes a camera device file and generates camera intrinsics (camera matrix and distortion coefficients). Output matrices written to YAML. Usage documented in script
* `src/undistort.py`: Offers visual comparison between raw and undistorted camera stream using intrinsics YAML generated by `cameracal`.
Also configures camera to be in trigger mode (for use with external 60fps trigger circuit to synchronize exposures on both cameras)
as well as white balance, exposure, and similar settings. Extraneous functionality will be moved to separate configuration script.
Usage documented in script.
